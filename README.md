## Hi, my name is Drew Sellers.

I'm a computer engineer who's worked on just about any type of project and environment you can imagine. Here, you'll find a collection of software based on my interests and things I've found valuable over the years that might be helpful to others.

Stealing GitHub's suggestions ðŸ˜„:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a universal interface for commanding spacecraft.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced machine learning techniques.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing prediction models for motion planning.

- âš¡ Fun facts about me: I'm a U.S. citizen, but I lived for some time in Munich, Germany. I love surfing and have surfed on both coasts of the U.S. and Hawaii as well as in France, Spain, and Portugal. I like fantasy novels from artists like Brandon Sanderson, Michael J. Sullivan, and Patrick Rothfuss. I also like anime and PC gaming.
